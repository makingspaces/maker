# MakingWithTink.com
Tink is a Claude-powered chatbot built to support makers.
The website runs through github and utilizes Netlify and Google Sheets.

Rather than providing all the answers or instructions to the maker, Tink asks questions to better understand the context of the project. The intention behind this design is to help the maker think more critically about the project and to eventually hopefully integrate the questions into their project design without the aid of Tink.

Tink collects images of finished projects alongside the makersâ€™ reflections and then will reference past community projects in conversation with the current maker. This helps people to learn from each other and be inspired by the work that they see others have already completed.
