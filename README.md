# MakingWithTink.com
Tink is a Claude-powered chatbot built to support makers.
The website runs through github and utilizes Netlify and Google Sheets.

#How the Project Design Enhances Human Agency
Rather than providing all the answers or instructions to the maker, Tink asks questions to better understand the context of the project. The intention behind this design is to help the maker think more critically about the project and to eventually hopefully integrate the questions into their project design without the aid of Tink.

Tink collects images of finished projects alongside the makersâ€™ reflections and then will reference past community projects in conversation with the current maker. This helps people to learn from each other and be inspired by the work that they see others have already completed.

An alternative approach to the learning challenge could be to provide the maker with all the information they requested or more in an attempt to solve the problem for them and anticipate any of the issues that may arise. While that may result in the maker being able to build more quickly, the final product may likely feel less meaningful and could lose the sense of the purpose of making the object, especially as someone choosing to make something rather than purchase may have multiple intentions by making an object beyond just having the finished product.
